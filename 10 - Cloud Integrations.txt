Cloud Integrations:
------------------

Section Introduction:
--------------------
• When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
• There are two patterns of application communication
	1) Synchronous communications (application to application)
	2) Asynchronous / Event base (application to queue to application)
• Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
• What if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually it’s 10?
• In that case, it’s better to decouple your applications:
	• using SQS: queue model
	• using SNS: pub/sub model
	• using Kinesis: real-time data streaming model
• These services can scale independently from our application!

Amazon SQS – Simple Queue Service: What’s a queue?
-------------------------------------------------

Amazon SQS – Standard Queue:
---------------------------
• Oldest AWS offering (over 10 years old)
• Fully managed service (~serverless), use to decouple applications
• Scales from 1 message per second to 10,000s per second
• Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
• No limit to how many messages can be in the queue
• Messages are deleted after they’re read by consumers
• Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive)
• Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally

SQS to decouple between application tiers:
-----------------------------------------

Amazon Kinesis:
--------------
• For the exam: Kinesis = real-time big data streaming
• Managed service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale
• Too detailed for the Cloud Practitioner exam but good to know:
	• Kinesis Data Streams: low latency streaming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources
	• Kinesis Data Firehose: load streams into S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, etc…
	• Kinesis Data Analytics: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL
	• Kinesis Video Streams: monitor real-time video streams for analytics or ML
	
Kinesis (high level overview):

Amazon SNS:
----------
• What if you want to send one message to many receivers?

Amazon SNS:
----------
• The “event publishers” only sends message to one SNS topic
• As many “event subscribers” as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications
• Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages
• Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic, 100,000 topics limit

Amazon MQ:
---------
• SQS, SNS are “cloud-native” services: proprietary protocols from AWS
• Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
• When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
• Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for
• Amazon MQ doesn’t “scale” as much as SQS / SNS
• Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover
• Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)

Integration Section – Summary:
-----------------------------
• SQS:
	• Queue service in AWS
	• Multiple Producers, messages are kept up to 14 days
	• Multiple Consumers share the read and delete messages when done
	• Used to decouple applications in AWS
• SNS:
	• Notification service in AWS
	• Subscribers: Email, Lambda, SQS, HTTP, Mobile…
	• Multiple Subscribers, send all messages to all of them
	• No message retention
• Kinesis: real-time data streaming, persistence and analysis
• Amazon MQ: managed message broker for ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ in the cloud (MQTT, AMQP.. protocols)
