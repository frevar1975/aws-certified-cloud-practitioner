Cloud Monitoring:
----------------

Amazon CloudWatch Metrics:
-------------------------
• CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS
• Metric is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn…)
• Metrics have timestamps
• Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics

Important Metrics:
-----------------
• EC2 instances: CPU Utilization, Status Checks, Network (not RAM)
	• Default metrics every 5 minutes
	• Option for Detailed Monitoring ($$$): metrics every 1 minute
• EBS volumes: Disk Read/Writes
• S3 buckets: BucketSizeBytes, NumberOfObjects, AllRequests
• Billing:Total Estimated Charge (only in us-east-1)
• Service Limits: how much you’ve been using a service API
• Custom metrics: push your own metrics

Amazon CloudWatch Alarms:
------------------------
• Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
• Alarms actions…
	• Auto Scaling: increase or decrease EC2 instances “desired” count
	• EC2 Actions: stop, terminate, reboot or recover an EC2 instance
	• SNS notifications: send a notification into an SNS topic
• Various options (sampling, %, max, min, etc…)
• Can choose the period on which to evaluate an alarm
• Example: create a billing alarm on the CloudWatch Billing metric
• Alarm States: OK. INSUFFICIENT_DATA, ALARM

Amazon CloudWatch Logs:
----------------------
• CloudWatch Logs can collect log from: 
	• Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application 
	• ECS: collection from containers 
	• AWS Lambda: collection from function logs 
	• CloudTrail based on filter 
	• CloudWatch log agents: on EC2 machines or on-premises servers 
	• Route53: Log DNS queries 
• Enables real-time monitoring of logs 
• Adjustable CloudWatch Logs retention

CloudWatch Logs for EC2:
-----------------------
• By default, no logs from your EC2 nstance will go to CloudWatch
• You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want
• Make sure IAM permissions are correct
• The CloudWatch log agent can be setup on-premises too

Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events):
-----------------------------------------------
• Schedule: Cron jobs (scheduled scripts)
• Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something
• Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages…

Amazon EventBridge Rules:
------------------------

Amazon EventBridge:
------------------
• Schema Registry: model event schema
• You can archive events (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period)
• Ability to replay archived events

AWS CloudTrail:
--------------
• Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
• CloudTrail is enabled by default!
• Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by:
	• Console
	• SDK
	• CLI
	• AWS Services
• Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
• A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.
• If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!

AWS X-Ray:
---------
• Debugging in Production, the good old way:
	• Test locally
	• Add log statements everywhere
	• Re-deploy in production
• Log formats differ across applications and log analysis is hard.
• Debugging: one big monolith “easy”, distributed services “hard”
• No common views of your entire architecture
• Enter… AWS X-Ray!
• Visual analysis of our applications

AWS X-Ray advantages:
--------------------
• Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks) 
• Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture 
• Pinpoint service issues 
• Review request behavior 
• Find errors and exceptions 
• Are we meeting time SLA? 
• Where I am throttled? 
• Identify users that are impacted 

Amazon CodeGuru:
---------------
• An ML-powered service for automated code reviews and application performance recommendations
• Provides two functionalities
	• CodeGuru Reviewer: automated code reviews for static code analysis (development)
	• CodeGuru Profiler: visibility/recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)
	
Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer:
------------------------
• Identify critical issues, security vulnerabilities, and hard-to-find bugs
• Example: common coding best practices, resource leaks, security detection, input validation
• Uses Machine Learning and automated reasoning
• Hard-learned lessons across millions of code reviews on 1000s of open-source and Amazon repositories
• Supports Java and Python
• Integrates with GitHub, Bitbucket, and AWS CodeCommit

Amazon CodeGuru Profiler:
------------------------
• Helps understand the runtime behavior of your application
• Example: identify if your application is consuming excessive CPU capacity on a logging routine
• Features:
	• Identify and remove code inefficiencies
	• Improve application performance (e.g., reduce CPU utilization)
	• Decrease compute costs
	• Provides heap summary (identify which objects using up memory)
	• Anomaly Detection
• Support applications running on AWS or on- premise
• Minimal overhead on application

AWS Health Dashboard - Service History:
--------------------------------------
• Shows all regions, all services health
• Shows historical information for each day
• Has an RSS feed you can subscribe to
• Previously called AWS Service Health Dashboard

AWS Health Dashboard –Your Account:
----------------------------------
• Previously called AWS Personal Health Dashboard (PHD)
• AWS Account Health Dashboard provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you.
• While the Service Health Dashboard displays the general status of AWS services, Account Health Dashboard gives you a personalized view into the performance and availability of the AWS services underlying your AWS resources.
• The dashboard displays relevant and timely information to help you manage events in progress and provides proactive notification to help you plan for scheduled activities.
• Can aggregate data from an entire AWS Organization

AWS Health Dashboard –Your Account:
----------------------------------
• Global service
• Shows how AWS outages directly impact you & your AWS resources
• Alert, remediation, proactive, scheduled activities

Monitoring Summary:
------------------
• CloudWatch:
	• Metrics: monitor the performance of AWS services and billing metrics
	• Alarms: automate notification, perform EC2 action, notify to SNS based on metric
	• Logs: collect log files from EC2 instances, servers, Lambda functions…
	• Events (or EventBridge): react to events in AWS, or trigger a rule on a schedule
• CloudTrail: audit API calls made within your AWS account
• CloudTrail Insights: automated analysis of your CloudTrail Events
• X-Ray: trace requests made through your distributed applications
• Service Health Dashboard: status of all AWS services across all regions
• Personal Health Dashboard: AWS events that impact your infrastructure
• Amazon CodeGuru: automated code reviews and application performance recommendations
