AWS STS (SecurityToken Service):

• Use cases
	• Identity federation: manage user identities in external systems, and provide them with STS tokens to access AWS resources
	• IAM Roles for cross/same account access
	• IAM Roles for Amazon EC2: provide temporary credentials for EC2 instances to access AWS resources

---------------------------
• Identity for your Web and Mobile applications users (potentially millions)
